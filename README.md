# Day 8 : Storing Registered User Data in Online Database - MongoDB Atlas
User Registration Logic

Check Email Existence : Check if email already registered
Hash Password : Securely hash the password
Create User :  Create a new user with hashed password
Save to DB :  Save user data to the database
Respond :  Respond with "Registration Successful" or handle errors. 

# Day 9 : Secure User Authentication with JWT in MERN App(JSON Web Token)
JSON Web Token (JWT Token)
JWT is a standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.
JWTs can be encrypted to provide secrecy between parties using JWE.
JWTs can also be used as OAuth 2.0 Bearer Tokens.
JWT are used for authentication and authorization.


Always stored in the user side as cookies and local storage.
Components of JWT   
Header :  The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.
Payload :  The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data.
Signature :  To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.

# Day 13 : Registration and Login Validation Using ZOD in MERN App
ZOD is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. It is designed to be as lightweight and fast as possible while providing a complete set of validation rules for any use-case. Zod is built entirely on TypeScript generics, so there is no need to define a separate type for your schemas. Zod is also fully compatible with Node.js and browsers.
